- create table layout in html
- style it modernish (scss)
- clock/timer (JS timer)
- flag mode, select mode (button)
- see how big to make grid; generate squres with javascript
- number of bombs; random locations (assign random value to html table data)
    - <td value="two"> </td> for 2 adjacent bombs, <td value="bomb"> </td>, <td value="empty"> </td> etc
    - need a way to count number of bombsa

- 3 situations:
    - Is a bomb (game over)
    - Is a number (shows number of adjacent mine)
    - Is empty space (reveals all other empty space if every surrounding tile is empty; recursive?)


JS functions - maybe seperate into different JS files too
    - create grid
    - Position bombs in random locations    
    - Recursilvy reveal empty spaces
    - count adjacent bomb
    - Game over if bomb
    - flag sites


-other note; add linux stuff to CV maybe?



What I've Learned
-------------------
- Creating tables dynamically with JS
- Altering classes dynamically with JS
- Randomness in JS - assign bomb class to a random number of boxes via Math.floor
- While loops in JS (Assiing a set number of bombs)

- Working on the recursive algo for unvealing adjacent boxes
    - Achieved using callback functions
- Altering innerHTML via JS
- Using functions as input for other functions (callback functions); adjacentSquares
- Making cells equal size despite not being occupied (add invis backslash char)
- .split method for splitting strings based on delimiter
- parseInt to alter value of cell depending on surrounding bomb count
- SCSS variables for colour
